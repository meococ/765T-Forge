# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Product SemVer is independent of Phase labels and MCP protocol/SDK versions.
See [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Publish-ready Wave 0: Autoloader R25.1 + valid GUIDs; `%APPDATA%` install guidance; NOTICE upstream attribution; `docs/history/build-brief.md`; embedded matrix/safety in server publish; `RELEASE_STATUS.txt` from pack script
- PublishReceipt + PDF probes + actionable preflight findings + foreground plot policy
- IssueSetContract lite, standards pack v2 plot bindings, field/rev gates, timeout read-back protocol
- Differential issue-set receipts, read-only sheet inventory, batch resume metadata
- Plugin-dispatch CI sync; Dependabot; scoped open-world `*` denylist; ADR honesty for headless AccoreConsole path
- Linework QA wave: `forge_linework_segments` (flat segment feed, meters/transformed endpoints), `forge_linework_compare` (per-item CAD↔Revit marking `matched`/`partial`/`missing_in_revit`/`extra_off_cad` + matched pairs + Z filter + SVG overlay), `forge_linework_transform` (server-side similarity/affine calibration from anchor pairs with persisted calibration file and >0.5 m residual warning); explicit `layerSuffix`/`layerMatch` xref-safe layer filtering on all `forge_linework_*` tools

### Changed

- MCP contract: `Ok=false` is `tools/call` `isError`, read from structured content or the JSON text (output schema stays off). Failed gates, probes, missing read-back, `updated=0`, and queued commands are not success. Backup path sits beside the payload. `forge_qa_preflight` and `forge_sheet_inventory_import` are not read-only. Server name `765T-Forge` with instructions. Task support is forbidden. Linework tools stay on the surface.
- Roadmap SemVer reconciled with capability matrix (registry/packs/resources are 0.2.0 shipped, not 0.3.0 targets)
- Removed `companion-skill/` stub; added `docs/README.md` + `AGENTS.md`
- Maintainer smoke-lab pass recorded (2026-07-11) against live AutoCAD 2026; `scripts/smoke-lab.ps1` helper

### Security

- Denylist additions (old patterns kept): `E`/`_.E` + `ALL`, destructive `ssget "_X"`/`"_A"`, `strcat`/`eval` with `ALL` or `ssget`, executor `SAVE`/`QSAVE`/`SAVEAS`/`WBLOCK`, and command-anchored `NETLOAD`/`APPLOAD`/`ARXLOAD`/`(load`/`SCRIPT`/`SHELL`/`SH`. `ZOOM *` stays allowed. Batch dry-run scans script bodies. A missing backup blocks the write.
- Open-world denylist no longer blocks every `*` (scoped to selection idioms); headless script path documented as server-side SafetyPolicy only

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

> Tag/release when smoke-lab has a maintainer pass and **both** server + plugin zips are attached. Until then treat 0.2.0 as the product SemVer in-tree; GitHub Release links below apply after the first public tag.

### Added

#### Wave 0 — Publish hygiene

- MIT `LICENSE` and Autodesk `NOTICE.md`
- Community files: `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Honest [docs/capability-matrix.md](docs/capability-matrix.md) and architecture/safety/install docs
- Cursor / Claude Desktop examples and `skills/765t-forge/`
- CI (`ci-server.yml`), release workflow/scripts, issue/PR templates
- Fail-closed pipe token (`FORGE_AUTOCAD_TOKEN`); `FORGE_DEV_ALLOW_DEFAULT_TOKEN` for local only
- `AUTOCAD_2026_ROOT`-driven plugin HintPath
- Product SemVer `0.2.0` + envelope version constant

#### Wave 1 — Real publish

- Configurable `forge_plot_to_pdf` (device, paper, CTB/STB, area, orientation, scale)
- Real DSD `forge_plot_publish` via `Publisher.PublishDsd` + PDF verify
- Sync layer-state restore and page-setup apply
- Overwrite acknowledgement for PDF/publish/pack
- Undo marks around typed writes

#### Wave 2 — Moat QA + campaign

- `forge_qa_preflight` + structured `QaReport` artifacts
- `forge_block_campaign` titleblock campaigns with dry-run diffs
- `forge_xref_normalize_relative`

#### Wave 3 — Scale

- `forge_batch_run` AccoreConsole job queue
- `forge_recipe_issue_set` issue-set orchestrator
- `forge_pack_and_go` + `manifest.json`
- Eval scenarios under `evals/`

### Security

- Removed `default-secret-token` production fallback
